# Northwestern Pre-work Study Guide

## Description


- What was your motivation?
The goal with this project was to create a study guide for all of the prework for the Northwestern Bootcamp. We learned about Git, Control Flow, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## User Story 
As a bootcamp student, I want the prework notes to be structured on a webpage, so that I can easily find the information.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given the prework project repository, 
When I read or view the README for the repository, 
THEN I can see a professional README that provides  information on the project and how to use it.
